# DSC259: Final Project

- **Objective:** Create several visualizations to help understand distributions of key variables, assess the missingness mechanisms of columns with missing values, test a hypothesis about the data, and finally, build and improve a predictive model

## Deliverables: Checkpoints and Final Submission

### Checkpoint 1

1. **Select Dataset**
    [] Which of the three datasets did you choose? Why?

2. **Create plot**
    [] Upload a screenshot of a plotly visualization created while completing Step 2: EDA

3. **Hypothesis Testing** 
    [] What is the pair of hypotheses you plan on testing in Part 1, Step 4?
    [] What is the test statistic you plan on using?

4. **Select Predictor**
    [] What is the column you plan on trying to predict in Part 1, Steps 5-8?
    [] Is it a classification or regression problem?

    *note: create `.tex` answering each of these questions and submit on gradescope*

### Checkpoint 2

1. **Hypothesis Testing** 
    [] What are the two hypotheses tested
    [] What were the results of the hypothesis testing?

2. **Baseline Model**
    [] Explain baseline model selected
    [] Detail plans to improve

3. **GitHub Page**
    [] Submit a working GitHub page webpage URL for the project

    *note: github page needs atleast a project title*

    *note: create `.tex` answering each of these questions and submit on gradescope*

### Final submission

1. **Notebook to PDF**
    [] Submit `.pdf` of notebook on gradescope

2. **GitHub Page**
    [] Submit link to GitHub page for project 

    *note: export to pdf is fine even if looks terrible.. just need code*

    *note: notebook should include link to website*

    *note: notebook should not be public*

## Rubric

- **Criteria:** Just satisfy requirements and boom full points

1. **Step 1: Introduction**
    [] TODO: detail this step

2. **Step 2: Data Cleaning and Exploratory Analysis**
    [] Cleaned data
    [] Perform univariate analyses
    [] Perform bivariate analyses
    [] Perform aggregations

3. **Step 3: Assessment of Missingness**
    [] Addressed NMAR question
    [] Performed permutation tests for missingness
    [] Interpreted missingness test results

4. **Step 4: Hypothesis Testing**
    [] Selected relevant columns for a hypothesis or permutation test
    [] Explicitly stated a null hypothesis
    [] Explicitly stated an alternative hypothesis
    [] Performed a hypothesis or permutation test 
    [] Use a valid test statistic
    [] Compute p-value and make a decision 

5. **Step 5: Framing a Prediction Problem**
