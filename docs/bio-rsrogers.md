### Background
I am a student at UCSD focusing on the intersection of data science and public infrastructure. For the DSC259 final project, I focused on the initial data ingestion and the missingness analysis.

### Technical Contributions
* **Data Ingestion:** Automated the pipeline for the Purdue Power Outage dataset.
* **Analysis:** Performed permutation tests to determine if missing climate data was NMAR.
* **Visualization:** Created the interactive plotly maps for the final report.
